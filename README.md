# Rainbow

This project will give you a chance to practice the skills you learned in the first lesson of the iOS 101 course. Follow the instructions below:

### Create an Xcode Project

1. Create a new Xcode project
2. Name the project "Rainbow"
3. Make sure you select Swift as the development language

### Add Buttons to the App

1. Open the app's Main.storyboard file.
2. Add six buttons to the main screen
3. Each button's title should be a different color
4. Use the Add Missing Constraints option to make sure the buttons are properly constrained

### Create Actions for Each Button

1. Create an IBAction for each button in ViewController.swift
2. In each action, change the view's background color to the color that corresponds to the button's title

### Build, Run, and Test Your App

1. Build and run your app using the simulator
2. Test each button to make sure that it changes the background color appropriately.

If everything works, congratulations! You've just built your first iOS app on your own from scratch!
